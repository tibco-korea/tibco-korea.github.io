Instead, build plugins based adapter architecture. Remember stand alone runtime &quot;adapters&quot; can always be reproduced from plugin anyway if needs to be, with the benefit of matching the target company interface and policy standard such as tracking for example (which is never the case with out of the box SDK adapters....).

I recommend always using explicit url parameters to help the instructors retain their sanity.  The course materials need a clearer picture of how the discovery and listen url's participate in the creation of a connection.

Spent time troubleshooting that had NOTHING to do with TIBCO, and EVERYTHING to do with userXX.  

I would recommend completely overhauling this mess!  At the very least I would do something like user##, such that when ever you see ## that means to actually replace it with your own student number.  And for cases where you have userXX, just have user.  I can't believe you used the same verbiage to represent 2 different things.  Then enter in, userYY; you got to be kidding me.

You must fix this and stop ignoring these suggestions, I am 100% comfident you have heard this before.",4,5,"Instructor was a very good instructor.  But my suggestion (for most instructors) is that their company puts them in the field for a couple months or more per year.

11/17/2014,4,3,"I am a TIBCO Administrator with a Development background.  My primary expectation for the course was to have a better understanding of BW &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, i.e., from a Development perspective.  Additionally, I wanted to have a better understanding of how to navigate BW designer, and how to &quot;read the code&quot;.",Yes.,The course is a survey course: it gives the student an overview of several aspects of the product.  So it is hard to isolate any particular topic as being &quot;most&quot; helpful.,Not applicable to this course.,4,5,"Overall, Fred was very well suited for this course.  This is the 3rd instructor-led course I hav taken, and of the three, this was the most well-executed course.

I am still deciding on how much I liked his presentation style, however.  I certainly don't dislike it by any means.  In fact, my only caveat is that I noticed that he spent a great deal of time going over the lab instructions. And this was certainly beneficial: I noticed that the students had far, far fewer challenges with the labs in this course than I have previously observed.  And this is not because there are fewer opportunities for errors - if anything, the opposite is true.

The downside of this approach is that the time spent reviewing the labs is done at the expense of discussing/exploring the concepts.  Consequently, the upshot is that this course experience was far more &quot;What you see (in the book) is what you got&quot;.

Is this a good thing or bad thing?  That is the part I am still trying to decide.  On the one hand, I got what was advertised.  On the other hand, I wonder if I could have gotten the same result via a self-guided instruction.

Nonetheless, is there anything specific that I would change?  Not really.  ",AMER
11/17/2014,4,3,"I was actually pointed to this class via the training website.  I wanted to get EMS Admin training and to take the EMS351 and the Hawk302 courses, it said this was a pre-req.  Seemed like this was more for the developers.
However, I feel knowing how the IDE works will help me to establish better best practices and carefully choose naming conventions and standards.  On top of that, I will be developing an in house solution to take messages from various servers and parse the messages to determine what to do with them (decide whether or not to notify someone.  so what I have learned in this course will come in handy for that.",I was really wishing this class was face to face in a class room.  ,I thought it was very powerful to learn how to put XPath statements in the Input.  I will definitely be brushing up my XPath (and xslt) now.  I also really liked the ability to create custom Java and how it is used and interacts with BW.,"I found myself just following the lab, and not really understanding why we were doing what we were doing.  Seems like the lab does a good job of explaining &quot;how&quot; to do tasks and &quot;what&quot; those are done for, but &quot;why&quot; you would pick that to begin with, was not really covered.

Perhaps the &quot;why&quot; is more for a design or advanced class?",4,4,"This is my 3rd class with Fred (and I have a 4th with him the next 2 days for EMS).  He is a great instructor and &quot;know what he knows&quot; cold.  He didn't seem to me to be a developer and that is ok (neither am I), I believe for this class it is ok.  For me, when it is a class that I want to get the most out of it is nice to have a teach with real world experience.  
He is a great teacher, but could use a refresh in the work place where these tools are being used.  ",AMER

Either way, they could still provide TIBCO with proper performance conducisve of a class room environment.

We use JNDI for everything and have a dedicated central fault tolerant EMS Server instance pair dedicated to just JNDI.  We use it to create location transparency for the jms clients that use EMS and have used it to move connection factories around to different servers. VERY powerful tool and very understated in this course.,4,4,"Fred is a great instructor, no doubt.  Always knows the material on hand inside and out, and does a great job pointing out the gotchas that hindered other students.  However, I feel he could gain a little more working knowledge of the product.  This could be done many ways.  Spending some time on TIBCommunity (to see all the types of issues and questions that come up), helping out TIBCO PSG from time to time (at least in the south east), playing around on a home office set up, of differenet scenarios, etc, etc.  Questions about how the technology is used outside the course material/labs, typically end up in &quot;I will have to look that up for you&quot;.  
I understand TIBCO has to balance having competent people who can instruct with those that are competent to architect/design/implement solutions for customers; but having spent some time with a couple sides of TIBCO (PSG, Training, Engineering, Support (and unfortunately Sales ;-) I believe that each area needs to have a little experience of the others.  PSG has to train, Engineering sometimes supports, Training should know basic implementation and support, etc.  I think it would make TIBCO a better company.

1) We had an MDM Architect in the class.  At a couple of points both Ademola and Pramod were talking about the same thing, cutting each other off.  A bit confusing.
2) Ademola's style of presenting examples of the concept and having ad hoc discussions on the course material is disconnected from the take home material.  I agree with Ademola that live examples are better than dry slide walkthroughs.  However, with the ad hoc nature there is not a direct connection between the take-home material and notes and what he is presenting in class.  There needs to be a better connection to the permanent material and class book.
      Also, it would help if the product material was better tied to the conceptual or logical model.  Sometimes it felt that the material was looking at individual pieces and actions, and I got lost in the details and couldn't related it back to how what we were doing fit in the big picture.","Covering all the pieces of using the product, development, administration, operations.",Time spent on the new User Interface was laborious and overly detailed.
